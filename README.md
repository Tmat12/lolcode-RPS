# lolcode-RPS
Basic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using lolcode.

Developed during my spare time to test my problem solving skills for a language that I had never seen before.

I chose this language because I wanted to work with a language that was limited and didn't have a lot of functionality that I was used to. This started to be a problem when I was developing the random number generator, as this language doesn't have a good way to get a random seed. I ended up asking the player for their favorite number and age in order to give the "feel" of a random seed, as often these two numbers vary between person to person so it became pseudo-random. I think that this solution worked very well and made this project a good test for my problem solving capabilities.
